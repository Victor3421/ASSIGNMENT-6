# ASSIGNMENT-6

### Overview

This repository contains optimized Python and R scripts for developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with six layers to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. The CNN is built using Keras, and predictions are made for the first two images from the test dataset.
